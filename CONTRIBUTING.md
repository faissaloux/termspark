# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests.
Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Process

1. Fork the project
3. Create a new branch
3. Code, **test**, commit and push
4. Open a pull request detailing your changes.

## Guidelines

* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.

## Setup

Clone your fork, then install the dev dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```
## Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```
or
```bash
python -m pytest
```

> **Note**
> Make sure tests cover 100%
```bash
pytest --cov
```
